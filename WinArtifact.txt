Regarding the qt5 Windows artifact, RcloneBrowser.exe requires:
Qt5Core.dll
Qt5Gui.dll
Qt5Widgets.dll
Qt5WinExtras.dll
qwindows.dll

Typically, Qt shared libraries are distributed with the executable.  .appveyor.yml details a 64-bit VS12 build against msvc2013 Qt5.8 which would be:
https://download.qt.io/archive/qt/5.8/5.8.0/qt-opensource-windows-x86-msvc2013_64-5.8.0.exe

Download Qt5.8 and, using 7-zip file manager, right-click and "Open Inside #"  A numbered list of files and headers are shown.  We need 12.7z and 50.7z:

12.7z\5.8\msvc2013_64\bin:
Qt5Core.dll
Qt5Gui.dll
Qt5Widgets.dll

12.7z\5.8\msvc2013_64\plugins\platforms:
qwindows.dll

50.7z\5.8\msvc2013_64\bin:
Qt5WinExtras.dll


The same can be found in a slightly newer version within 72.7z and 112.7z:

https://download.qt.io/archive/qt/5.9/5.9.8/qt-opensource-windows-x86-5.9.8.exe

72.7z\5.9.8\msvc2013_64\bin:
Qt5Core.dll
Qt5Gui.dll
Qt5Widgets.dll

72.7z\5.9.8\msvc2013_64\plugins\platforms:
qwindows.dll

112.7z\5.9.8\msvc2013_64\bin:
Qt5WinExtras.dll


Select the files noted and extract them to the folder containing RcloneBrowser.  Create a shortcut to the .exe with "Target":

cmd.exe /c "SET QT_QPA_PLATFORM_PLUGIN_PATH=. && START /D ^".^" RcloneBrowser.exe"

This will prepare the QT environment appropriately for RcloneBrowser without affecting other Qt installations.  A global install of Qt may break the program so I recommend avoiding that.
